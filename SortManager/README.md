<h4 align="center">Here is where i have uploaded my Sort manager project , this will have different ways on how to sort an array.</h4>
<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality 

### <p align="center">Bubble Sort</p>
A bubble sort algorithm goes through a list of data a number of times, comparing two items that are side by side to see which is out of order. It will keep going through the list of data until all the data is sorted into order. Each time the algorithm goes through the list it is called a ‚Äòpass‚Äô.
### <p align="center">QuickSort</p>
Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
### <p align="center">InsertionSort</p>
An insertion sort is less complex and efficient than a merge sort, but more efficient than a bubble sort.An insertion sort compares values in turn, starting with the second value in the list. If this value is greater than the value to the left of it, no changes are made. Otherwise this value is repeatedly moved left until it meets a value that is less than it. The sort process then starts again with the next value. This continues until the end of the list is reached.
### <p align="center">SelectionSort</p>
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
### <p align="center">MergeSort</p>
A merge sort uses a technique called divide and conquer. The list is repeatedly divided into two until all the elements are separated individually. Pairs of elements are then compared, placed into order and combined. The process is then repeated until the list is recompiled as a whole.
### <p align="center"> BinaryTreeSort</p>
Tree sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on Binary Search Tree data structure. It first creates a binary search tree from the elements of the input list or array and then performs an in-order traversal on the created binary search tree to get the elements in sorted order.
